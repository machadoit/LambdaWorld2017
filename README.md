# LambdaWorld2017

Slides and demos for my workshop [The Fast & the Functional: C# 7](http://www.lambda.world/schedule/#session-107) delivered at Lambda World 2017.

You will find 4 C# projects in this repo:
- **FunctionalCSharp7**: the complete code used to create the slides, updated to C# 7.1.
- **SWAPISDK-Initial**: the initial code of the workshop developed in C# 5, that we will update to C# 7.1.
- **SWAPISDK-Final**: the final code that we get at the end of the workshop, with all the refactoring and updates made to SWAPISDK-Initial using the new stuff in C# 6, C# 7 and C# 7.1.
- **SWAPISDK-All**: same as SWAPISDK-Initial project but with all of the pieces of code in SWAPISDK-Final in comments along the code they replace.

If you want to try this code download [.NET Core 2.0 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor with its [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp) for Windows, Linux or macOS. You may also use Visual Studio 2017 for Windows. If these tiny tutorials work, you are ok to go:
